# for loop, data, iteration, 10 customers, send Eid Mubarak, iterate over msg
# for iteration, we need an iterator, one by one:

i = 10
# continue == will skip that single iteration
# break will end the whole loop

# boys = ["rehan1","mubashir2","third3"]
# # the iterator is just a pointer which points to an element of a list at a given time,
# # starting from the index 0 to the end of the list, and in this case it's "i"
# for i in boys:
#     print(i)

# for c in "mubashir":
#     print(c)

# for i in range(5):
#     for j in range(5):
#         print(j+1, ": j", i+1, " :i")
#         print("----------")
#     print("iteration complete of:", i+1)
